# Guess the Number Game
 This is a simple yet engaging "Guess the Number" game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, part of the JavaScript Web Development Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also includes features like keeping track of the number of guesses, showing a winning message, and offering a reset option to start a new game. This project is great for learning basic JavaScript functionality, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
